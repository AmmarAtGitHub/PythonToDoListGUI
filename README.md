# To-Do List App

## Description
This is a simple desktop To-Do List application built with Python and Tkinter. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks with a straightforward graphical user interface.

## Features
- Add new tasks to your to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from the list
- Clean and simple user interface

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Clone this repository or download the source code
```
git clone https://github.com/AmmarAtGitHub/PythonToDoListGUI.git
cd PythonToDoListGUI
```

## How to Run
Execute the main Python script:
```
python todo_list.py
```

## How It Works
The application uses Tkinter to create a graphical user interface with the following components:
- Text input field for entering tasks
- "Add Task" button to add new tasks
- List display for viewing all tasks
- "Complete Task" button to mark selected tasks as done
- "Delete Task" button to remove tasks

## Code Structure
- `add_task()`: Adds a new task to the list
- `complete_task()`: Marks a selected task as completed
- `delete_task()`: Removes a selected task from the list

2. Click "Add Task" to add it to your list
3. Select a task and click "Complete Task" to mark it as done
4. Select a task and click "Delete Task" to remove it
